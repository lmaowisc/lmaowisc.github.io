Collaborators always come to me for help with power analysis. More often than not, their studies involve *repeated measurements*---multiple observations per subject over time or under different conditions. And inevitably, the power of their study depends on a crucial, yet elusive, parameter: the *correlation* between repeated measurements.

This is where things get frustrating. When I ask, *"What do you think the correlation between measurements should be?"* I usually get blank stares or vague responses like *"Umm, maybe like 0.5?"* or *"I have no idea, what do you think?"*---which, of course, is the whole reason they're asking me for help in the first place.

But what if there were a better way? Instead of asking investigators to pluck a correlation coefficient out of thin air, we could ask them a question they can actually answer.

## Introducing the CESS

The **Chance of Erring on the Same Side (CESS)** is a simple yet intuitive measure: it’s the probability that two repeated measurements for the same subject fall on the same side of their respective means. In other words, if you measure a subject twice, what's the chance that both measurements are above (or both below) their respective averages?

Most investigators can make a reasonable guess for this: *"About 70% of the time, I expect that if the first measurement is above average, the second one will be too."* That’s an answer we can work with!

## Converting CESS to correlation

Graphically, CESS represents the probability mass in the first and third quadrants of a bivariate coordinate system. If the two measurements are positively correlated, this probability mass will be greater than 0.5 (see figure below). The stronger the correlation, the greater the mass.

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(MASS)
library(ggplot2)

# Generate bivariate normal data
set.seed(42)
Sigma <- matrix(c(1, 0.6, 0.6, 1), 2, 2)
data <- mvrnorm(10000, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = Sigma)
df <- data.frame(x = data[,1], y = data[,2])

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 3, ymin = 0, ymax = 3), fill = "gray80", alpha = 0.2) +

A precise formula exists for a bivariate normal distribution with correlation $\rho$:

$$
\text{CESS} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\arcsin(\rho)}{\pi}.
$$

To solve for $\rho$:

$$
\rho = \sin\left( \pi \cdot \text{CESS} - \frac{\pi}{2} \right).
$$

This formula can be found in, e.g., @mardia2024. It gives us a direct way to translate an intuitive probability estimate into the correlation parameter needed for power analysis.

## Example: from investigator input to power calculation

Let’s say an investigator tells us:

> *"I think there’s about a 75% chance that two measurements from the same subject will be on the same side of their means."*

Then, plugging into the formula:

``` r
cess <- 0.75
rho <- sin(pi * cess - pi / 2)
rho
```

This returns:

``` output
[1] 0.707
```

So, instead of awkwardly guessing, we now have a data-informed estimate: $(\rho \approx 0.707)$. This can be used directly in power calculations for mixed models, repeated measures ANOVA, or longitudinal analyses.

## Conclusion

Next time someone asks for a power analysis but has no idea about their correlation structure, try the CESS approach. It replaces guesswork with an intuitive probability that investigators can actually reason about.
